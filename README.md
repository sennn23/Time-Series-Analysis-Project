# Time Series Analysis of Electricity Consumption in India
# Project Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electricity consumption across different regions of India using historical data from 2013 to 2023. The main objective is to predict regional electricity consumption for the year 2024. The analysis is based on time series data and involves the use of two forecasting models: Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA).

# Dataset
The data was sourced from the Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO). The dataset spans January 2013 to December 2023, with monthly frequency and includes:

Date: Month and year of the data.
Electricity consumption: Measured in million units (MU) for each state and union territory.
The dataset is aggregated into four major regions of India: North, South, East, and West, to capture broader consumption patterns.

# Objectives
Forecast electricity consumption for each region (North, South, East, and West) for the year 2024.
Analyze and predict consumption patterns for the top three states with the highest consumption: Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.
Methods
The following time series forecasting methods were applied:

Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing: Captures trends and seasonality.
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): Accounts for seasonality, trends, and other time series components.
# Key Results
SARIMA models consistently outperformed Holt-Winters in terms of accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Forecasts for each region and the top three states were generated using the best-fitting models.
Forecasting Performance
Model accuracy was measured using MAPE and MSE for both Holt-Winters and SARIMA. The SARIMA model yielded better results, with MAPE as low as 2.10% for some regions.
